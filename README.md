 MATPLOTLIB Hw Assignment 
 
The languages that were used in this assignment were Python/jupyter notebook and the packages/tools imported were matplotlib.py, pandas, and scipy.stats.

The tasks that were done throughout were:
1) Prepare, Clean, and Merge datasets into one dataframe.
2) Generate a Summary statistics Dataframe containing a row for each regimen.
3) Generate two bar charts showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study using DataFrame.plot() and pyplot methods.
4) Generate two pie charts show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study while using DataFrame.plot() and pyplot methods.
5) Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across the four treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Then, calculate the quartiles and IQR, and determine if there are any potential outliers.
6) Using Matplotlib, generate a box plot that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group.
7) Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot.
8) Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

The csv files used are found in the Data folder and the main script is found in the jupyter notebook named 'Pymaceuticals.ipynb'.
